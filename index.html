			<h2>My Personal Information</h2>
		</header>
		<div class="content">
				<p><strong>Background information:</strong>
					<p>I’m Australian by nationality and Bengali by ethnicity. 
						I was born in Bangladesh, but I travelled here as a kid and ended up growing up here. 
						I’ve finished my kindergarten, primary and secondary schooling and now in my first year of the Bachelor of Information Technology. 
						I speak Bangla at home as well as English, and can read a bit of Arabic. (Just the basics). 
						I have a black and white shorthair cat. His name is Mystic (seems pretty cool right?), and I love him to bits, even though he’s the literal devil. 
						I’ve always been a fan of the arts, such as music, fine art and design. 
						Coming from an Asian background, its uncommon to have a career in such an industry. 
						To include at least a little bit of design into my life, I’m considering to combine IT and design into my future, and found an interesting career choice that may be “the one”; Information Architecture. 
						In my free time, I like to read, cook and listen to music. (Also, Netflix and chilling, but that’s beside the point).</p>

							<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>What is my interest in IT? When did my interst in IT start? Was there a a particular
								event or person that sparked my interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)</strong> 
								<p>My interest in IT comes from my dad. 
									When he was younger, he was an IT technician and programmer, so it heavily influenced me to start a career in IT. 
									I like computers and I like technology. 
									I believe that the future is essentially technology so it’d be wise to get on the train now. 
									I want to make a big impact on the world (somehow). 
									My dad came to Australia to study, and when he finished, he didn’t really make it into the industry because everything else was blowing up in the early 2000s. 
									I want to finish what he started, sometimes I feel that he is living his could-be life through me because he is also interested in what I learn in regards to IT.</p>

							<h2>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>I partly chose to come to RMIT because it was closer to me and party chose it because of the great program.
								I was also considering Swinburne, but their IT course wasn't as good as RMIT.
								Plus I love the location of RMIT since it’s in the city, there are many restaurants and shops to visit and it’s a new adventure every time I leave the house. 
								RMIT offers a range of different programs and has flexible and straight forward timetables and enrolment processes. 
								I found that it was easier to enrol into RMIT than Swinburne. 
								RMIT also has very friendly staff and students, who really care for education and success and I find that being in this kind of environment really gives me the boost to be the best I can be. 
								There are a lot of study areas in the city campus, and it’s very easy to just sit and study, basically anywhere.</p>

							<p>I expect to learn a lot about myself as a person and the way that I learn. 
								I hope to learn a lot about my interests in certain areas of IT and learn more programming techniques and more database structuring and organising. 
								I like organising and working with technology. 
								I also like to design things as well as have a deep interest in UX/UI.</p>

									<div class="content">
									<p>This position includes all the things that I would want in a job, such as the permanent position. 
										The payment for the job seems really good too, but I’m more of a fan of their morals. 
										They believe in gender equality and I do too. 
										The future of STEM and technology depends on everyone, not just one gender. 
										I don’t believe in companies that have a bias over which gender is better. 
										Because I believe that everyone gets equal opportunity.</p>

									<p>This job requires a generous amount of experience and qualifications due to its very permanent position. 
										This position involves having to have qualifications of the following: Bachelor Degree in Business, Information Technology etc.</p>
										<p>In regards to experience, this job requires their employees to have experiences in the field, 
										such as information architecture, digital analysis and development, 
										data analysis, data, integration/migration/transformation, business rule management, 
										business architecture/design and digital business transformation.</p>

											<p>A description (in my own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience I currently have.</p>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
										<p>At the moment, I don’t have much experience in the IT industry in specific areas. I haven’t worked in the IT field before which would be hard to get a job at first. 
											But I did dedicate a part of my high schooling to my IT-related subjects which has given me some knowledge on what it’s like to work and be an expert in the field. 
											I also did an IT work experience that is dedicated to girls who are aspiring to join the IT industry in the future or who are interested in it. 
											The company is called TATA Consultancy Services and it was a week of business, legal and IT mixed together. 
											A lot of friends were made along the way and it gave me more insight into what it’s like to work there. 
											It further deepened my interest.</p>

											<p>A plan describing how I will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those I have now.</p>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
										<p>I want to be able to finish this course first, and get my degree. 
											By then, I’m sure I’d have found my interest in the IT field. So, before I get to in to the workforce, I want to be able to do my masters in IT and get that finished so I can start earning. 
											Straight away, with all these qualifications and no experience, I would have to start off small at a company, at this point, I don’t think the company really matters, I just want to be able to find a job/internship that is related to my field. 
											Eventually, by working hard, I’d move up the ladder and get to the job that I want.
											 Most of these information architect jobs require some amount of experience, but I wouldn’t have much. 
											 In this case, when I have enough experience, I’ll be able to apply for higher positions.</p>

			<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
			<p>These are some results for the various tests that a potential employer might find useful when considering me for a position.</p>
		</header>
	<div class="content">
			<div class="gallery">
			<a href="images/test results/pic01.jpg" class="landscape"><img src="images/test results/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
			<a href="images/test results/pic03.jpg" class="landscape"><img src="images/test results/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
			<a href="images/test results/pic05.jpg" class="landscape"><img src="images/test results/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
		<p></p>
				<p><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you? How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? How should you take this into account when forming a team?</strong> 
					<p>By taking these tests, I learned more about what I am, and how I’m like as a person, I always knew that I was an introvert. 
						And these tests proved it. These tests portray how I am like in the workplace as well as in just normal day to day life.
						These results would heavily influence a team if I were to be working with them on a project because sometimes too many of the same person can get challenging to work with.
						In a group, there shouldn’t be more introverts, for example. Or too many turbulent, or too many judging people. 
						It should be evenly balanced with the right amount of every person; if not one of each kind for a successful group, with multiple ideas shining through. </p>

							<h2>Project Idea</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>My project idea consists of using a smartphone, and it’s called Smilenomics. It’s a smartphone app that that lets you send and receive positive messages with strangers when you feel disconnected. By creating this kind of project, I want to be able to connect people and create an atmosphere where people may feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings as well as providing support, and a little pick-me -up for those days that make people feel hopeless. 
								I hope to create a platform where people would be able to share these nice messages and favourite and share them to spread love. We all have those days where being blue is completely all that we feel and it brings out entire day to a halt, stopping it from being the best day it could be. This app would change those days and turn that frown upside down.
									Studies show that more than 1 in 3 people said they worried (38 percent) or dealt with stress (37 percent), according to the 2018 Global Emotions Report, released on Wednesday by Washington, D.C. (based analytics and consulting firm Gallup). 
									That’s more than a quarter of the world, that experiences unhappiness in their life. This app could change their life, because of the undeniable amount of support users would experience and feel by sharing and receiving positive messages that would put a smile on someone’s face; hence why Smilenomics is a cheap and easily assembled solution to this problem.
									Features of the app, Smilenomics is a service for the general public, no matter what age. 
									It closely resembles a social media platform, but instead of statuses, there are positive messages that will spread around; with the help of what we call “Supporters” and the “Supported”. If there is an immediate need for a pick-me-up, there will be an option where you tap a button a pop-up would appear, with a delightful message. This message would contain fewer or a large amount of words, anecdotes, a handwritten message and/or voice message. 
									All of these messages will be moderated by the system in case of abusive language or inappropriate content. As a user, you can “heart” publicly posted messages and send friend requests. There will also be report buttons just in case there is someone who is using the app as a platform to spread hate, through hate speech, bullying etc. The tool and technology that I would use is Swift. With this mobile app developer, there is minimal coding involved and the app would be easy to maintain. This would be convenient for me, as I would like to use less coding as possible for the application. I like the designing part of the app, creating sleek and clean designs that would be easier for the user to use. 
									The skills that are needed for this app to be created is to know the different design elements to centre the app around the user, since they will be using this app the most. 
									Skills such as product management, design skills, writing skills, testing skills, coding, cross-platform and data skills will be needed to make this app absolutely successful for a good cause. 
									For the outcome of this app, it would help lots of people from all over the world, people of all ages as the Smilenomics community would have support for each other and be supported through tough times. This would affect people and people’s moods as it would drastically change them for the better. By planting positivity on one person, more and more will spread and grow and it would completely change the world, one smile at a time.
